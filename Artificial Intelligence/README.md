## Artificial Intelligence (C++)
The lesson's target is to introduce the students to the basic ideas of AI (Search algorithms, Genetic algorithms, Knowledge representation etc.). The assignment demands the modeling of **Water Sort Game**'s states and the transitions from one state to another based on the game's rules. Subsequently, an implementation of **Breadth-First Search** algorithm is requested to find the optimal route of transitions from a random initial state to a winning state.
