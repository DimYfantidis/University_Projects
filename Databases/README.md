## Databases (SQL)
The course's target is to introduce the students to Relational Algebra and SQL. The assignment requests the design of a database with an ER diagram, based on the **Entity-Relationship Model**. Specific conversions are then applied to the ER diagram to generate the equivalent relational model. Finally, the resulting relational model is written in SQL.
