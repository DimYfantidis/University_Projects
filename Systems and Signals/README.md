## Systems and Signals (MATLAB)
The course's target is to introduce the students to linear time-invariant and periodic signals, as well as Fourier, Zeta and Laplace transforms; both in their continuous and discrete nature. The assignment requests the implementation of **overlapp-add** and **overlap-save** methods to apply band-pass filtering to digital media.
