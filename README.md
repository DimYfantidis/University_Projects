# University Projects
An exhaustive list with every programming-related school assignment.

# 1st Semester
* ## Basic Programming Principles (C)
  Lesson's target is the teaching of the C programming language. The program's purpose is to test the student's knowledge of the language of the C language regarding dynamic memory allocation, keyboard I/O, file I/O, strings of characters and functions. The assignment also tests the student's competence in problem solving. Several metric functions regarding the lucky numbers game of the national lottery were implemented.

# 2nd Semester
* ## Data Structures (C++)
  Lesson's target is the teaching of basic data structures. Several data structures containing alphanumerics were implemented such as Dynamic Unordered array, Dynamic Ordered array, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Hash Table (Unordered Map). 
<br/>


# 3rd Semester
* ## Numerical analysis (C++)
  Lesson's target is the teaching of solving continuous problems using methods for numeric approximation. **Seven different problems** were requested to be solved. A plethora of numeric methods were implemented: Dichotomy method, Newton-Raphson method, Secant method, $PA = LU$ decomposition, Cholesky decomposition, Gaus-Seidel method, a simplified version of Google's **pagerank** algorithm, Polynomial approximation, Spline interpolation, Least Squares method, Simpson's rule and Trapezoidal rule.
* ## Object Oriented Programming (Java)
  Lesson's target is the teaching of the Java programming language as well as certain of OOP's principles. The assignment requests the implementation of a simple "travel guide" program, similar to Airbnb and booking.com with pseudo-network programming and pseudo-accounts (the entire java program is offline). The pseudo-platform consists of Customer accounts, Admin accounts and Accomodation Provider accounts. The program utilises different types of accommodations, booking mechanics, timing/date mechanics etc. and disposes a GUI implemented with the **Java Swing Library**.
