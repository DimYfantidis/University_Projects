# University Projects
An exhaustive list with every programming-related school assignment.

# 1st Semester
* ## Basic Programming Principles (C)
  Lesson's target is the teaching of the C programming language. The program's purpose is to test the student's knowledge of the language of the C language regarding dynamic memory allocation, keyboard I/O, file I/O, strings of characters and functions. The assignment also tests the student's competence in problem solving. Several metric functions regarding the lucky numbers game of the national lottery were implemented.
