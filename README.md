# University Projects
An exhaustive list with every programming-related school assignment.

# 1st Semester
* ## Basic Programming Principles (C)
  Lesson's target is the teaching of the C programming language. The program's purpose is to test the student's knowledge of the language of the C language regarding dynamic memory allocation, keyboard I/O, file I/O, strings of characters and functions. The assignment also tests the student's competence in problem solving. Several metric functions regarding the lucky numbers game of the national lottery were implemented.

# 2nd Semester
* ## Data Structures (C++)
  Lesson's target is the teaching of basic data structures. Several data structures containing alphanumerics were implemented such as Dynamic Unordered array, Dynamic Ordered array, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Hash Table (Unordered Map). 
<br/>


# 3rd Semester
* ## Numerical analysis (C++)
  Lesson's target is the teaching of solving continuous problems using methods for numeric approximation. **Seven different problems** were requested to be solved. A plethora of numeric methods were implemented: Dichotomy method, Newton-Raphson method, Secant method, $PA = LU$ decomposition, Cholesky decomposition, Gaus-Seidel method, a simplified version of Google's **pagerank** algorithm, Polynomial approximation, Spline interpolation, Least Squares method, Simpson's rule and Trapezoidal rule.
* ## Object Oriented Programming (Java)
  Lesson's target is the teaching of the Java programming language as well as certain of OOP's principles. The assignment requests the implementation of a simple "travel guide" program, similar to Airbnb and booking.com with pseudo-network programming and pseudo-accounts (the entire java program is offline). The pseudo-platform consists of Customer accounts, Admin accounts and Accomodation Provider accounts. The program utilises different types of accommodations, booking mechanics, timing/date mechanics etc. and disposes a GUI implemented with the **Java Swing Library**.
<br/>


# 4th Semester
* ## Algorithms (Java)
  Lesson's target is broaden the students' knowledge on designing and analyzing algorithms. The 1st assignment requests to implement an algorithm of $\mathcal{O}(N logN)$ time complexity for the **skyline problem** of $N$ datapoints. The 2nd assignment requests the implementation of a dynamic-programming algorithm for the solution of **Dynamic Virtual Machine Placement in Cloud Computing**.
* ## Artificial Intelligence (C++)
  Lesson's target is to introduce the students to the basic ideas of AI (Search algorithms, Genetic algorithms, Knowledge representation etc.). The assignment demands the modeling of **Water Sort Game**'s states and the transitions from one state to another based on the game's rules. Subsequently, an implementation of **Breadth-First Search** algorithm is requested to find the optimal route of transitions from a random initial state to a winning state.
* ## Digital Communications (Java)
  Lesson's target is to introduce the stundents to basic principles of Telecommunications. The assignment requests to implement a program that simulates the procedures of sending and receiving messages through a noisy communication channel. Each message sent has a chance to be affected by the noise (bit flips) and when received **error correction** is applied to it through Cyclic Redundancy Check and modulo-2 arithmetic.

# 5th Semester 
* ## Computer Networks (Java)
* ## Databases (SQL)
* ## Operating Systems (C)
* ## Systems and Signals (MATLAB)
<br/>


# 6th Semester
* ## Computer Graphics (C)
* ## Foundations of Cryptography (Python)
* ## Machine Learning (Python)
<br/>


# 7th Semester
* ## Concurrent Programming and Software Safety (C)
* ## Microprocessors (x86 Assembly)
* ## Modeling - Digital Image Synthesis (C)
* ## Neural Networks - Deep Learning (Python)
