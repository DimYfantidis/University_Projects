## Microprocessors (x86 Assembly)
The course's goal is to introduce the students to Intel's processor architecture and teach them the basics of the x86 Assembly language. **Three programming assignments** were given in total. The 1st and 2nd ones request the writing of 16/32/64-bit assembly code (OP codes/mnemonics, registers, variables, code/data/stack segments, conditional statements, loops, procedures, interrupts, floating-point arithmetic, SIMD instructions) in the EMU-8086 emulator. Meanwhile, the 3rd one requires the writing of a C/x86 Assembly hybrid program by interfacing C source files and external x86 Assembly implementation files in Visual Studio using MASM.
