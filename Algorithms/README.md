## Algorithms (Java)
The lesson's target is broaden the students' knowledge on designing and analyzing algorithms. The 1st assignment requests to implement an algorithm of $\mathcal{O}(N logN)$ time complexity for the **skyline problem** of $N$ datapoints. The 2nd assignment requests the implementation of a dynamic-programming algorithm for the solution of **Dynamic Virtual Machine Placement in Cloud Computing**.
