Letter frequency is the number of times letters of the alphabet appear on average in written language. 
Letter frequency analysis dates back to the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi cAD, who formally developed the method to break ciphers. 
Letter frequency analysis gained importance in Europe with the development of movable type in AD, where one must estimate the amount 
of type required for each letterform. Linguists use letter frequency analysis as a rudimentary technique for language identification, 
where it is particularly effective as an indication of whether an unknown writing system is alphabetic, syllabic, or ideographic.
The use of letter frequencies and frequency analysis plays a fundamental role in cryptograms and several word puzzle games, including 
Hangman, Scrabble, Wordle and the television game show Wheel of Fortune. One of the earliest descriptions in classical literature of 
applying the knowledge of English letter frequency to solving a cryptogram is found in Edgar Allan Poe's famous story The Gold-Bug, where 
the method is successfully applied to decipher a message giving the location of a treasure hidden by Captain Kidd.citation needed

Bungee jumping, also spelled bungy jumping, is an activity that involves a person jumping from a great 
height while connected to a large elastic cord. The launching pad is usually erected on a tall structure such 
as a building or crane, a bridge across a deep ravine, or on a natural geographic feature such as a cliff. It is 
also possible to jump from a type of aircraft that has the ability to hover above the ground, such as a hot-air-balloon or helicopter. 
The thrill comes from the free-falling and the rebound.[1] When the person jumps, the cord stretches and the jumper flies upwards again 
as the cord recoils, and continues to oscillate up and down until all the kinetic energy is dissipated.

The Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the United States of America.[3] It superseded the Articles of Confederation, the nation's first constitution, in 1789. Originally comprising seven articles, it delineates the national frame and constraints of government. The Constitution's first three articles embody the doctrine of the separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into three branches: the legislative, consisting of the bicameral Congress (Article I); the executive, consisting of the president and subordinate officers (Article II); and the judicial, consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts (Article III). Article IV, Article V, and Article VI embody concepts of federalism, describing the rights and responsibilities of state governments, the states in relationship to the federal government, and the shared process of constitutional amendment. Article VII establishes the procedure subsequently used by the 13 states to ratify it. The Constitution of the United States is the oldest and longest-standing written and codified national constitution in force in the world today.[4][a]

The drafting of the Constitution, often referred to as its framing, was completed at the Constitutional Convention, which assembled at Independence Hall in Philadelphia between May 25 and September 17, 1787.[5] Delegates to the convention were chosen by the state legislatures of 12 of the 13 original states; Rhode Island refused to send delegates.[6] The convention's initial mandate was limited to amending the Articles of Confederation, which had proven highly ineffective in meeting the young nation's needs.[7] Almost immediately, however, delegates began considering measures to replace the Articles.[8] The first proposal discussed, introduced by delegates from Virginia, called for a bicameral (two-house) Congress that was to be elected on a proportional basis based on state population, an elected chief executive, and an appointed judicial branch.[9] An alternative to the Virginia Plan, known as the New Jersey Plan, also called for an elected executive but retained the legislative structure created by the Articles, a unicameral Congress where all states had one vote.[10]

On June 19, 1787, delegates rejected the New Jersey Plan with three states voting in favor, seven against, and one divided. The plan's defeat led to a series of compromises centering primarily on two issues: slavery and proportional representation.[11][12] The first of these pitted Northern states, where slavery was slowly being abolished, against Southern states, whose agricultural economies depended on slave labor.[13] The issue of proportional representation was of similar concern to less populous states, which under the Articles had the same power as larger states.[14] To satisfy interests in the South, particularly in Georgia and South Carolina, the delegates agreed to protect the slave trade, that is, the importation of slaves, for 20 years.[15] Slavery was protected further by allowing states to count three-fifths of their slaves as part of their populations, for the purpose of representation in the federal government, and by requiring the return of escaped slaves to their owners, even if captured in states where slavery had been abolished.[16] Finally, the delegates adopted the Connecticut Compromise, which proposed a Congress with proportional representation in the lower house and equal representation in the upper house (the Senate) giving each state two senators.[17] While these compromises held the Union together and aided the Constitution's ratification, slavery continued for six more decades and the less populous states continue to have disproportional representation in the U.S. Senate and Electoral College.
