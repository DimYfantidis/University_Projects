The Advanced Encryption 
Standard (AES), 
also known by its 
original name Rijndael 
is a specification for 
the encryption of 
electronic data 
established by the 
U.S. National Institute 
of Standards and 
Technology (NIST) in 
2001. AES is a variant 
of the Rijndael block 
cipher developed by two 
Belgian cryptographers, 
Joan Daemen and Vincent 
Rijmen, who submitted a 
proposal to NIST during 
the AES selection process. 
Rijndael is a family of 
ciphers with different 
key and block sizes. 
For AES, NIST selected 
three members of the 
Rijndael family, each 
with a block size of 
128 bits, but three 
different key lengths: 
128, 192 and 256 bits.
AES has been adopted 
by the U.S. government.
It supersedes the Data 
Encryption Standard (DES), 
which was published in 1977.
The algorithm described by 
AES is a symmetric-key 
algorithm, meaning the same 
key is used for both 
encrypting and decrypting 
the data.
In the United States, AES 
was announced by the NIST as 
U.S. FIPS PUB 197 (FIPS 197) 
on November 26, 2001. 
This announcement followed 
a five-year standardization 
process in which fifteen 
competing designs were 
presented and evaluated, 
before the Rijndael cipher 
was selected as the most 
suitable. 
On systems with 32-bit 
or larger words, it is 
possible to speed up 
execution of this cipher 
by combining the SubBytes 
and ShiftRows steps with 
the MixColumns step by 
transforming them into a 
sequence of table lookups. 
This requires four 256-entry 
32-bit tables (together 
occupying 4096 bytes). 
A round can then be performed 
with 16 table lookup 
operations and 12 32-bit 
exclusive-or operations, 
followed by four 32-bit 
exclusive-or operations 
in the AddRoundKey step. 
Alternatively, the table 
lookup operation can be 
performed with a single 
256-entry 32-bit table 
(occupying 1024 bytes) 
followed by circular 
rotation operations.
