## Neural Networks - Deep Learning (Python)
This course involves the exploration of advanced machine learning and deep learning models, such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, hebbian learning, as well as deep learning frameworks like Keras.
1. The first assignment involves the implementation of a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier** for the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. The second assignment involves **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** and SVM tuning.
3. The third assignment involves the implementation of a number sequence reconstruction program using an **Autoencoder**.
