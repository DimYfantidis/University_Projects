## Concurrency and Security in Software (C)
The course's target is to help students design concurrent algorithms and write concurrent code in different languages, thus extending their programming knowledge and capabilities. Theoretical concepts of Concurrency involve the critical sector's problem, mutual exclusion, semaphores, monitors, time scheduling for multiple processes and distributed systems design. These are all taught by studying concurrent algorithms such as Lamport's bakery algorithm, the Byzantine Generals problem, etc. in a manner that is not language specific (pseudocode). An optional programming assignment was given in which students could choose a problem from the book ([Principles of Concurrent and Distributed Programming](https://books.google.com/books/about/Principles_of_Concurrent_and_Distributed.html?id=oP-2hpMEdb8C&redir_esc=y) by *M. Ben-Ari*) and implement its solution in the programming language of their preference.
