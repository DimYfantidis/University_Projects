Describe the process you followed to achieve this result. How did you choose your classifier and your parameters and why. Report the f-measure (weighted) & balanced accuracy, using 10-fold stratified cross validation, of your final classifier. Can you achieve a balanced accuracy over 88%, while keeping the training time low? (Tip 1: You can even use a model from the previous parts, but you are advised to test additional configurations, and ensemble architectures, Tip 2: If you try a lot of models/ensembles/configurations or even grid searches, in your answer leave only the classifier you selected as the best!)"

In the end, I found a combination of parameters that scored above 88% in both F1 wighted and Balanced Accuracy but, as mentioned above, the cell that loads the database doesn't use the `RANDOM_STATE` variable. As a consequence, the program was not consistent in scoring above the threshold in different sessions. `XGBoost` proved to be the only consistent enough."
