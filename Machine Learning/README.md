## Machine Learning (Python)
The courses's aim is to introduce students to Machine Learning in the context of Data Analysis. **Three assignments** were given in the form of Interactive Python Notebooks (Headers + report). In all three assignments, the student experiments with different types of ML models and reports the requested results. Also, each assignment includes small open-ended questions to test theory comprehension. Assignment breakdown:
1. The first assignment involves a revision of the NumPy & Pandas libraries, implementing & training Linear Models (Linear Regression & Logistic Regression), plotting and analyzing results/data, data regularization.
2. The second assignment involves the teaching of the Scikit-Learn library, its Decision Tree Classifiers and Pipelines, evaluation metrics, model visualization, hyperparameter tuning.
3. The final assignment involves using and testing ensemble models such as voting classifiers, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Bagging and Microsoft's XG-Boost.
